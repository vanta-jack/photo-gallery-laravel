## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

In addition, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

You can also watch bite-sized lessons with real-world projects on [Laravel Learn](https://laravel.com/learn), where you will be guided through building a Laravel application from scratch while learning PHP fundamentals.

## Agentic Development

Laravel's predictable structure and conventions make it ideal for AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Install [Laravel Boost](https://laravel.com/docs/ai) to supercharge your AI workflow:

```bash
composer require laravel/boost --dev

php artisan boost:install
```

Boost provides your agent 15+ tools and skills that help agents build Laravel applications while following best practices.

## Demo reset baseline

Reset the app to the deterministic demo dataset (demo user/admin, lifecycle milestones, photos/albums/posts/guestbook, and engagement records):

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Demo runbook

### 1) Install and prepare

```bash
composer install
bun install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan storage:link
```

### 2) Seed deterministic demo data

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

Demo accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User | `user@domain.com` | `password` |
| Admin | `admin@domain.com` | `password` |

### 3) Build and run for demo

```bash
bun run build
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

Open:

- Local desktop: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Other devices on same LAN (phone/tablet): `http://<your-lan-ip>:8000`

Find your LAN IP with:

```bash
ip -4 addr show | grep -oP '(?<=inet\\s)\\d+(\\.\\d+){3}' | grep -v '^127\\.'
```

### 4) Demo flow checklist

1. Guest flow:
   - Browse home feed (`/`) and switch feed filters.
   - Open guestbook (`/guestbook`) and create a guest entry.
2. Authenticated user flow:
   - Sign in as `user@domain.com`.
   - Review and manage photos (`/photos`) and albums (`/albums`).
   - Create/edit guestbook entries and verify profile attribution.
3. Admin flow:
   - Sign in as `admin@domain.com`.
   - Open admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) and perform moderation actions.

### 5) Pre-demo validation

```bash
php artisan test --compact
bun run build
```
